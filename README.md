## Choosing your newsletter style 
Before you choose the platform you publish your newsletter on, you should have an idea about who the audience of the newsletter is. You should also consider the type of newsletter you want to publish. This will help inform what platform you want to publish it on.

I recommend thinking of a specific person you are writing your newsletter for. Be very specific, think about their age, where they live, what their interests are, level of education etc. You want to get as specific as possible. You can even give them a name if you want! 

Next, think about the type of newsletter content you want to produce. What value are you creating for this person? 

There are multiple different types of newsletters you can write. Here are some examples:
- News - You keep your audience up to date with current events in your field. You can add your perspective and take on whatever is happening
- Aggregator - You can aggregate information on a topic so that readers can have all their resources in one place on a topic (this is common for financial newsletters). Many aggregators also aggregate news
- Analysis - You give deep insights into a domain or topic
- Sales / Deals / Product recommendations - You give your readers tools, deals, and product reviews about things you use yourself
- Company newsletter / promotional - Keep users up to date with new product developments and information
- Internal team newsletter - Companies send internal newsletters for updates within an organization
- Blog - Keep readers informed about your life and experiences
- Event newsletter - Keep community up to date with thinks happening online or in person

I've seen a few types of newsletters become very popular in the last few years. 
1) Analysis newsletters - Giving unique insights from your personal perspective on a topic or industry seems to be harder to commoditze than aggregators or news
2) Local newsletters - These have an even greater connection with readers because you may even see them at local events. People often also feel more connected to their local communities than the broader world. 
  

## Choosing your platform 
Do you have to choose? If price isn't an option or if you're not sure. I actually recommend publishing your newsletter on multiple platforms. Almost all of these have different benefits, and although maybe you spread you list across a few platforms, the slight extra work can be worth it. For example, having the paid growth features from Beehiiv + the organic growth capabilitiy of Substack could be a real benefit if you're trying to find your best path to growth early on. 

I'm currently building a platform called Newsletter Hero to allow you to write your newsletter in one place and post it to multiple platforms. 

With that being said, I think three platforms are generally good for most of the populations. These 3 are Beehiiv, Substack, and Kit. They have slightly different value adds, so let's break them down:


### [🐝 Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com?via=Ken-Jee)

* **Ease of use:** **User-Friendly but Powerful.** It has a modern, clean interface ("Apple-like" aesthetic). While it is easy to write in, there is a slightly steeper learning curve than Substack because it offers significantly more customization options, analytics, and website design tools.
* **Price:** **Free up to 2,500 subscribers.**
    * **Paid Plans:** Start at roughly ~$39/month.
    * **Revenue Cut:** **0%.** Beehiiv does *not* take a cut of your subscription revenue.
    * * **Access to Features:** **0%.** You need to pay for at least the cheapest monthly paid plan $39/month in order to get access to all of the unique features (below)
* **Who this is for:** Creators who treat their newsletter as a **business**. It is ideal for marketers, growth-focused writers, and those who want robust SEO and deep analytics without giving up a % of revenue.
* **Unique features:**
    * **Ad Network:** Built-in access to premium sponsors.
    * **Boosts:** A paid recommendation network to grow or earn.
    * **3D Analytics:** Extremely detailed data on subscriber sources.
    * **Referral Program:** Built-in rewards system for sharing.
    * **Audio Newsletter:** Users can listen to newsletter instead of read them

> **💡 Opinion:** In my opinion, Beehiiv is a platform that is the best for paid growth. This is a good balance for those trying to build a brand as well as those who are trying to grow their business.

### [🧡 Substack](https://substack.com/)

* **Ease of use:** **Extremely High.** The simplest platform to start on. The interface is minimalist and distraction-free. You can set up and publish in minutes with zero technical setup.
* **Price:** **Free to use (forever).**
    * **Revenue Cut:** **10%.** They take 10% of your paid subscription revenue forever (plus Stripe fees). No monthly platform fee.
* **Who this is for:** Pure **writers, journalists, and hobbyists** who want to focus 100% on writing and 0% on tech/marketing.
* **Unique features:**
    * **Notes:** A social-media-style feed (like X/Twitter) for internal traffic.
    * **Mobile App:** A dedicated app for reading, keeping emails out of the "Promotions" tab.
    * **Recommendation Network:** Powerful engine for organic writer-to-writer growth.

> **💡 Opinion:** Substack is the best for people who don't have an existing audience and don't want to pay for one. Substack has the best organic growth in my opinion. They have a notes feature that acts much like X/Twitter. This enables you to reach people outside of your current subscriber list. They also have an app that many people use to read the newsletters that they subscribe to.

### 📨 Kit (formerly ConvertKit)

* **Ease of use:** **Moderate.** Kit is a professional marketing tool. The backend (automations, tagging, segments) is more complex than Beehiiv or Substack and has a steeper learning curve.
* **Price:** **Freemium (Free up to 10k subs for basic use).**
    * **Paid Plans:** Required for automations, starting ~$29/month.
    * **Revenue Cut:** **3.5% + $0.30** per transaction for digital products.
* **Who this is for:** **Professional creators** who sell products (courses, ebooks, coaching) rather than just newsletters. The industry standard for those needing advanced email funnels.
* **Unique features:**
    * **Visual Automations:** Best-in-class tool for building complex email sequences (funnels).
    * **Commerce:** Sell digital products and subscriptions directly.
    * **Tagging & Segmentation:** Highly advanced user management.
    * **Kit App Store:** Custom integrations that help you write, scale, and monetize your newsletter

> **💡 Opinion:** Kit is the best platform for creators who want to **sell digital products** and automate their business. Unlike Substack and Beehiiv, which focus primarily on the "newsletter" as the product, Kit acts as a backend engine to sell *other* things (like courses or coaching). If you need your email list to automatically "funnel" people into buying products, Kit is the superior choice.

### 📊 Quick Summary

| Feature | Beehiiv | Substack | Kit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | Growth & Business | Writers & Community | Sales & Automation |
| **Growth Type** | Paid & SEO | Organic (Network) | Funnels & Products |
| **Fees** | Flat monthly fee (0% cut) | Free monthly (10% cut) | Monthly fee + small cut |
| **Difficulty** | Low-Medium | Very Low | Medium-High |

### Other Platforms to Consider (Medium & LinkedIn)
While Beehiiv, Substack, and Kit are excellent for *managing* an audience you already have, they can be "walled gardens"—it is hard for strangers to find your work there.

To fix this, many creators use **Medium** and **LinkedIn** as secondary platforms to capture new readers and funnel them to their main newsletter.

### 📝 Medium

* **Why use it:** Medium has high "Domain Authority" (SEO). Articles published here often rank higher on Google than a new personal website or Substack. It also has an internal recommendation algorithm that pushes your content to strangers interested in your topic.
* **Key Newsletter Features:**
    * **The "Import" Tool:** You can one-click import posts from your main newsletter. Medium automatically adds a "canonical link," telling Google that your original newsletter is the source (protecting your SEO).
    * **Partner Program:** You can get paid simply for people reading your work (based on reading time), creating a small secondary income stream.
    * **Publications:** You can submit your newsletter issues to large Medium "Publications" (e.g., *The Startup*, *Better Marketing*) to instantly reach hundreds of thousands of followers.

### 💼 LinkedIn Newsletters

* **Why use it:** LinkedIn is currently the best platform for B2B and professional growth. When you start a LinkedIn Newsletter, the platform aggressively notifies your connections and followers to subscribe, often leading to rapid initial growth.
* **Key Newsletter Features:**
    * **In-App & Email Notifications:** Unlike a regular post, LinkedIn sends a push notification *and* an email to your subscribers whenever you publish.
    * **One-Click Subscribe:** It is frictionless for users to subscribe because LinkedIn already has their email address.
    * **SEO Indexing:** LinkedIn newsletters are indexed by Google and often appear in search results for professional queries.

## Choosing your newsletter style 
Before you choose the platform you publish your newsletter on, you should have an idea about who the audience of the newsletter is. You should also consider the type of newsletter you want to publish. This will help inform what platform you want to publish it on.

I recommend thinking of a specific person you are writing your newsletter for. Be very specific, think about their age, where they live, what their interests are, level of education etc. You want to get as specific as possible. You can even give them a name if you want! 

Next, think about the type of newsletter content you want to produce. What value are you creating for this person? 

There are multiple different types of newsletters you can write. Here are some examples:
- News - You keep your audience up to date with current events in your field. You can add your perspective and take on whatever is happening
- Aggregator - You can aggregate information on a topic so that readers can have all their resources in one place on a topic (this is common for financial newsletters). Many aggregators also aggregate news
- Analysis - You give deep insights into a domain or topic
- Sales / Deals / Product recommendations - You give your readers tools, deals, and product reviews about things you use yourself
- Company newsletter / promotional - Keep users up to date with new product developments and information
- Internal team newsletter - Companies send internal newsletters for updates within an organization
- Blog - Keep readers informed about your life and experiences
- Event newsletter - Keep community up to date with thinks happening online or in person

I've seen a few types of newsletters become very popular in the last few years. 
1) Analysis newsletters - Giving unique insights from your personal perspective on a topic or industry seems to be harder to commoditze than aggregators or news
2) Local newsletters - These have an even greater connection with readers because you may even see them at local events. People often also feel more connected to their local communities than the broader world. 
  

## Choosing your platform 
I think three platforms are generally good for most of the populations. These 3 are Beehiiv, Substack, and Kit. They have slightly different value adds, so let's break them down:



Beehiiv
- Ease of use:
- Price:
- Who this is for:
- Unique features: 
- In my opinion, Beehiiv is a platform that is the best for paid growth. This is a good balance for those trying to build a brand as well as those who are trying to grow their business.
- 

Substack
- Substack is the best for people who don't have an existing audience and don't want to pay for one. Substack has the best organic growth in my opinon. They have a notes feature that actus much like x/twitter. This enables you to reach people outside of your current subscriber list. They also have an app that many people use to read the newsletters that they subscribe to.

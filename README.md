<h2 id="2-choosing-your-newsletter-style">2. Choosing Your Newsletter Style</h2>

Before you choose the platform you publish your newsletter on, you should have an idea about who the audience of the newsletter is. You should also consider the type of newsletter you want to publish. This will help inform what platform you want to publish it on.

I recommend thinking of a specific person you are writing your newsletter for. Be very specific, think about their age, where they live, what their interests are, level of education etc. You want to get as specific as possible. You can even give them a name if you want!

Next, think about the type of newsletter content you want to produce. What value are you creating for this person?

There are multiple different types of newsletters you can write. Here are some examples:
* **News:** You keep your audience up to date with current events in your field. You can add your perspective and take on whatever is happening.
* **Aggregator:** You can aggregate information on a topic so that readers can have all their resources in one place on a topic (this is common for financial newsletters). Many aggregators also aggregate news.
* **Analysis:** You give deep insights into a domain or topic.
* **Sales / Deals / Product recommendations:** You give your readers tools, deals, and product reviews about things you use yourself.
* **Company newsletter / promotional:** Keep users up to date with new product developments and information.
* **Internal team newsletter:** Companies send internal newsletters for updates within an organization.
* **Blog:** Keep readers informed about your life and experiences.
* **Event newsletter:** Keep community up to date with things happening online or in person.

I've seen a few types of newsletters become very popular in the last few years:
1.  **Analysis newsletters:** Giving unique insights from your personal perspective on a topic or industry seems to be harder to commoditize than aggregators or news.
2.  **Local newsletters:** These have an even greater connection with readers because you may even see them at local events. People often also feel more connected to their local communities than the broader world.

<h2 id="3-choosing-your-platform">3. Choosing Your Platform</h2>

Do you have to choose? If price isn't an option or if you're not sure, I actually recommend publishing your newsletter on multiple platforms. Almost all of these have different benefits, and although maybe you spread your list across a few platforms, the slight extra work can be worth it. For example, having the paid growth features from Beehiiv + the organic growth capability of Substack could be a real benefit if you're trying to find your best path to growth early on.

I'm currently building a platform called **Newsletter Hero** to allow you to write your newsletter in one place and post it to multiple platforms.

With that being said, I think three platforms are generally good for most of the population. These 3 are Beehiiv, Substack, and Kit. They have slightly different value adds, so let's break them down:

<h3 id="beehiiv">🐝 <a href="https://www.beehiiv.com?via=Ken-Jee">Beehiiv</a></h3>

* **Ease of use:** **User-Friendly but Powerful.** It has a modern, clean interface ("Apple-like" aesthetic). While it is easy to write in, there is a slightly steeper learning curve than Substack because it offers significantly more customization options, analytics, and website design tools.
* **Price:** **Free up to 2,500 subscribers.**
    * **Paid Plans:** Start at roughly ~$39/month.
    * **Revenue Cut:** **0%.** Beehiiv does *not* take a cut of your subscription revenue.
    * **Access to Features:** You need to pay for at least the cheapest monthly paid plan ($39/month) in order to get access to all of the unique features (below).
* **Who this is for:** Creators who treat their newsletter as a **business**. It is ideal for marketers, growth-focused writers, and those who want robust SEO and deep analytics without giving up a % of revenue.
* **Unique features:**
    * **Ad Network:** Built-in access to premium sponsors.
    * **Boosts:** A paid recommendation network to grow or earn.
    * **3D Analytics:** Extremely detailed data on subscriber sources.
    * **Referral Program:** Built-in rewards system for sharing.
    * **Audio Newsletter:** Users can listen to newsletter instead of read them.

> **💡 Opinion:** In my opinion, Beehiiv is a platform that is the best for paid growth. This is a good balance for those trying to build a brand as well as those who are trying to grow their business.

<h3 id="substack">🧡 <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a></h3>

* **Ease of use:** **Extremely High.** The simplest platform to start on. The interface is minimalist and distraction-free. You can set up and publish in minutes with zero technical setup.
* **Price:** **Free to use (forever).**
    * **Revenue Cut:** **10%.** They take 10% of your paid subscription revenue forever (plus Stripe fees). No monthly platform fee.
* **Who this is for:** Pure **writers, journalists, and hobbyists** who want to focus 100% on writing and 0% on tech/marketing.
* **Unique features:**
    * **Notes:** A social-media-style feed (like X/Twitter) for internal traffic.
    * **Mobile App:** A dedicated app for reading, keeping emails out of the "Promotions" tab.
    * **Recommendation Network:** Powerful engine for organic writer-to-writer growth.

> **💡 Opinion:** Substack is the best for people who don't have an existing audience and don't want to pay for one. Substack has the best organic growth in my opinion. They have a notes feature that acts much like X/Twitter. This enables you to reach people outside of your current subscriber list. They also have an app that many people use to read the newsletters that they subscribe to.

<h3 id="kit-formerly-convertkit">📨 <a href="https://partners.kit.com/rkyyw46q4p6k">Kit (formerly ConvertKit)</a></h3>

* **Ease of use:** **Moderate.** Kit is a professional marketing tool. The backend (automations, tagging, segments) is more complex than Beehiiv or Substack and has a steeper learning curve.
* **Price:** **Freemium (Free up to 10k subs for basic use).**
    * **Paid Plans:** Required for automations, starting ~$29/month.
    * **Revenue Cut:** **3.5% + $0.30** per transaction for digital products.
* **Who this is for:** **Professional creators** who sell products (courses, ebooks, coaching) rather than just newsletters. The industry standard for those needing advanced email funnels.
* **Unique features:**
    * **Visual Automations:** Best-in-class tool for building complex email sequences (funnels).
    * **Commerce:** Sell digital products and subscriptions directly.
    * **Tagging & Segmentation:** Highly advanced user management.
    * **Kit App Store:** Custom integrations that help you write, scale, and monetize your newsletter.

> **💡 Opinion:** Kit is the best platform for creators who want to **sell digital products** and automate their business. Unlike Substack and Beehiiv, which focus primarily on the "newsletter" as the product, Kit acts as a backend engine to sell *other* things (like courses or coaching). If you need your email list to automatically "funnel" people into buying products, Kit is the superior choice.

<h3 id="summary--comparison-table">📊 Quick Summary</h3>

| Feature | Beehiiv | Substack | Kit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | Growth & Business | Writers & Community | Sales & Automation |
| **Growth Type** | Paid & SEO | Organic (Network) | Funnels & Products |
| **Fees** | Flat monthly fee (0% cut) | Free monthly (10% cut) | Monthly fee + small cut |
| **Difficulty** | Low-Medium | Very Low | Medium-High |

<h3 id="discovery-platforms-medium--linkedin">Other Platforms to Consider (Medium & LinkedIn)</h3>

While Beehiiv, Substack, and Kit are excellent for *managing* an audience you already have, they can be "walled gardens"—it is hard for strangers to find your work there.

To fix this, many creators use **Medium** and **LinkedIn** as secondary platforms to capture new readers and funnel them to their main newsletter.

#### 📝 Medium

* **Why use it:** Medium has high "Domain Authority" (SEO). Articles published here often rank higher on Google than a new personal website or Substack. It also has an internal recommendation algorithm that pushes your content to strangers interested in your topic.
* **Key Newsletter Features:**
    * **The "Import" Tool:** You can one-click import posts from your main newsletter. Medium automatically adds a "canonical link," telling Google that your original newsletter is the source (protecting your SEO).
    * **Partner Program:** You can get paid simply for people reading your work (based on reading time), creating a small secondary income stream.
    * **Publications:** You can submit your newsletter issues to large Medium "Publications" (e.g., *The Startup*, *Better Marketing*) to instantly reach hundreds of thousands of followers.

#### 💼 LinkedIn Newsletters

* **Why use it:** LinkedIn is currently the best platform for B2B and professional growth. When you start a LinkedIn Newsletter, the platform aggressively notifies your connections and followers to subscribe, often leading to rapid initial growth.
* **Key Newsletter Features:**
    * **In-App & Email Notifications:** Unlike a regular post, LinkedIn sends a push notification *and* an email to your subscribers whenever you publish.
    * **One-Click Subscribe:** It is frictionless for users to subscribe because LinkedIn already has their email address.
    * **SEO Indexing:** LinkedIn newsletters are indexed by Google and often appear in search results for professional queries.

<h2 id="4-writing-your-newsletter">4. Writing Your Newsletter</h2>

The platform you choose matters, but the **content** is what keeps people subscribed. If your writing is boring, no amount of SEO or paid ads will save you.

Here is a framework for creating content that people actually want to read.

### ✍️ Creating High-Quality Content

#### 1. Finding Your "Voice"
Your "voice" is what makes your newsletter sound like *you*, not a corporate robot. It is the reason people read *your* news analysis instead of just reading CNN.

* **Define your "Vibe Attributes":** Pick 3 adjectives that describe your style. Are you *Witty, Sarcastic, and Brief*? Or are you *Deep, Academic, and Empathetic*? Stick to these.
* **Write to ONE person:** Don't write to "my audience." Write to a specific friend or colleague. This instantly makes your writing more conversational and relatable.
* **Resource:** [How to Establish Your Brand Voice (Guidelines & Examples)](https://www.moo.com/blog/success-stories/how-to-write-your-tone-of-voice-guidelines)

#### 2. The "Unique Value Add" (UVA)
Why should someone give you 5 minutes of their week? You need a clear proposition.

* **Curator:** "I read 50 articles so you only have to read the best 3."
* **Expert:** "I spent 10 years in this industry so I can explain what this news *really* means."
* **Experimenter:** "I tried this new tool/diet/strategy so you don't have to waste money on it."
* **Resource:** [How to Write a Unique Value Proposition](https://cxl.com/blog/value-proposition-examples-how-to-create/)

#### 3. Storytelling 101
Facts tell, stories sell. Even if you are writing a technical or financial newsletter, wrapping your insights in a story makes them memorable.

**The Simple "ABT" Framework:**
* **And:** Set the scene. "We all want to grow our lists, **and** there are many tools to do it."
* **But:** Introduce the conflict. "**But** most of them are too expensive for beginners."
* **Therefore:** The solution. "**Therefore**, I tested free alternatives and found the best one."
* **Resource:** [7 Ways to Use Storytelling in Email Marketing](https://www.mailjet.com/blog/email-best-practices/email-marketing-storytelling/)

#### 4. The "Remix" Strategy (Repurposing)
You don't always need to write from scratch. Your newsletter can be the "Best Of" collection of content you've already created.
* **Twitter/LinkedIn to Newsletter:** Take your best-performing social post of the week and expand on it.
* **Video to Text:** Use AI tools to transcribe and summarize your YouTube videos into a text-based newsletter.
* **Resource:** [How to Repurpose Blog Content for Newsletters](https://moosend.com/blog/repurpose-blog-content/)

### 📧 Subject Lines
The subject line is the gatekeeper. If this fails, the content inside doesn't matter.

* **My complete subject line analysis / Guide:** [Reddit: 5 Lessons on Subject Lines from Studying 1,315 Campaigns](https://www.reddit.com/r/beehiiv/comments/1mcisye/5_lessons_on_subject_lines_from_studying_1315/)

### 🌐 Workflow: Multi-Platform Publishing
Once you've written a great issue, you should publish it on multiple platforms (Beehiiv/Substack for retention, LinkedIn/Medium for discovery).

The downside is that formatting one post for four different platforms is tedious and often breaks images/spacing.

To solve this, I am building **[Newsletter Hero](https://www.newsletterhero.ai/)**. It is a unified editor that allows you to write your newsletter **once** and publish it to Beehiiv, Substack, Medium, and LinkedIn simultaneously with perfect formatting.

<h2 id="5-deliverability-getting-into-the-inbox">5. Deliverability: Getting into the Inbox</h2>

You can write the greatest newsletter in the world, but if it lands in the **Spam folder**, it doesn't exist. Even landing in the **Promotions tab** (Gmail) reduces your open rates significantly compared to the **Primary tab**.

"Deliverability" is the art and science of proving to email providers (Google, Yahoo, Outlook) that you are a real person sending valuable content, not a spammer.

Here is the 4-step framework to ensure your emails actually get read.

<h3 id="1-the-technical-setup-dkim-spf-dmarc">1. The Technical Setup (DKIM, SPF, DMARC)</h3>

If you are sending from a generic address (e.g., `yourname@substack.com`), the platform handles this for you. However, if you are using a **Custom Domain** (e.g., `hello@yournewsletter.com`), you **must** set this up.

*Note: As of Feb 2024, Google and Yahoo reject emails from custom domains that do not have this set up.*

* **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** Think of this as your ID card. It tells Google which IP addresses are allowed to send emails on your behalf.
* **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Think of this as a wax seal on a letter. It ensures the email wasn't tampered with during transit.
* **DMARC:** This tells Google what to do if an email fails the check (usually, "reject it").

**✅ Action Item:** If you buy a custom domain, log into your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap) and add the CNAME/TXT records provided by Beehiiv or Kit immediately.

<h3 id="2-the-warm-up-phase">2. The "Warm Up" Phase</h3>

If you buy a new domain and send 5,000 emails on Day 1, you will go straight to spam. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) trust history. A new domain has no history.

* **Week 1:** Send to your safest 50 friends/family. Ask them to reply.
* **Week 2-4:** Slowly increase volume.
* **The "Reply" Hack:** The strongest signal to Google that you are important is if a user **replies** to your newsletter.
    * *Tactic:* In your welcome email, ask a simple question: "What is your #1 struggle with [Topic] right now? Hit reply and let me know."

<h3 id="3-escaping-the-promotions-tab">3. Escaping the "Promotions" Tab</h3>

The Promotions tab is not "Spam," but it is a graveyard where newsletters go to die. Getting to the "Primary" tab is the holy grail.

**How to get to Primary:**
* **Ask for it:** In your welcome email, explicitly say: *"Move this email to your Primary tab so you don't miss the next issue."*
* **Encourage "Whitelisting":** Ask users to add your email address to their contacts.
* **Limit Images/HTML:** Emails that look like "websites" (heavy coding, 50+ images) look like marketing. Emails that look like plain text look like letters from a friend. (Substack excels here by default; Beehiiv/Kit require restraint).

> **💡 Pro Tip:** If you use Beehiiv or Kit, try to keep your "Text-to-Image" ratio high. If your email is just one giant image poster, it will likely be flagged as spam.

<h3 id="4-list-hygiene-the-hardest-pill-to-swallow">4. List Hygiene (The Hardest Pill to Swallow)</h3>

It feels good to have 10,000 subscribers. But if 4,000 of them haven't opened an email in 6 months, they are destroying your reputation.

Google looks at your **Open Rate** to determine if you are spam.
* **Scenario A:** You send to 1,000 people. 500 open (50%). Google thinks: "This is high quality."
* **Scenario B:** You send to 10,000 people. 500 open (5%). Google thinks: "People ignore this. It must be spam."

**✅ Action Item:** Every 3–6 months, scrub your list. Create a segment of "Cold Subscribers" (haven't opened in 90 days) and send a re-engagement campaign. If they don't open that, **delete them**. A smaller, engaged list is infinitely more valuable than a large, dead one.

<h3 id="%EF%B8%8F-tools-for-warming-up-your-email">🛠️ Tools for "Warming Up" Your Email</h3>

If you have a brand new domain and want to speed up the process of building reputation, you can use "Warm-up" tools. These tools automatically send emails from your account to other real inboxes in their network, open them, and reply to them, simulating "perfect" engagement.

*(Note: I am not sponsored by any of these tools; they are simply the current industry standards as of 2025)*

* **[Smartlead](https://www.smartlead.ai/):** Currently the most popular for advanced users. It allows you to warm up unlimited email accounts for a flat fee.
* **[Warmup Inbox](https://www.warmupinbox.com/):** A simple, user-friendly option that gives you a clear "Health Score" for your domain.
* **[Mailreach](https://www.mailreach.co/):** Known for having a very high-quality network of inboxes (fewer bots, more real humans), which provides a better signal to Google.
